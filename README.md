# OnlineTests

This calculator was done using ASP.NET / MVC pattern. The inputs are not limited to two numbers, but you can insert any number of values with more than one mathematical operator.
A nice UI was designed rather than typical input fields. The structure of the project was done similarly to the industry level, dividing it into layers (service layer etc.) and writing tests using xUnit.
